# Introduction to Elastic Search Stack 

## What?

Elastic Search is an open source search engine written in Java
that can be used through an HTTP REST API.

It can also fit the definition of a document-oriented database.

It was first released in 2010, and is currently in version 7.x.

## Why?

It's a very powerful and scalable search engine.

A few example use cases:
  
   - search through TBs of documents
   - build complex dynamic search engines or statistics
     that can't be easily handled by relational RDBMS
   - aggregate data from a lot of sources
   - all of these examples all at once

## How?

Most cloud providers have an elastic search service available out of the box.
Elasticsearch company also has a cloud service.

The cost will mostly depends on the size of the database, 
and the computing power required.

But it's open source! 
So start up a few Docker containers, and you're up to play with it.
